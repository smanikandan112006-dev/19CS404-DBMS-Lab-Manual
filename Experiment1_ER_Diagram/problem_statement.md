# ER Diagram Workshop – Submission Template

## Objective
To understand and apply ER modeling concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

## Purpose
Gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent database structure including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

# Scenario A: City Fitness Club Management

**Business Context:**  
FlexiFit Gym wants a database to manage its members, trainers, and fitness programs.

**Requirements:**  
- Members register with name, membership type, and start date.
